main area with modular to-do lists for different things of a certain type
 - boards can be used for different purposes: adulting, chores, school, work, creative projects, etc.
 - each board will have an expandable calendar mode
 - to-do lists within those boards can have titles, subtitles: like within chores there can be personal hygiene, fish maintenance, kitchen, etc.
 - these things can be color-coordinated to one's preferences
 - items on a to-do list can have different flags, such as urgent and/or repeatable (with settings to dictate)
 - to-do list items can have sub-items as well

dashboard view features:
 - a condensed calendar view that incorporates all of the calendar items of all of the boards into one
 - a list of incomplete repeatable list items from all the boards
 - all of the upcoming items with due-dates
 - a "do today" list that includes manually added items without a set due date
